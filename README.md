# Note App

A command line note-taking application written in C!

## Features

- **Readability**: None
- **Error Handling**: Basically none
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Reads the entire file into RAM (probably).
- **User Experience**: Command line interface only—because I don't know how to make a GUI.

## How to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone`.
2. **Compile**: Run `gcc note_app.c -o note_app` and hope it works.
3. **Run (Windows)**: `noteapp <filepath>`
4. **Run (Linux)**: `./noteapp <filepath>` (something like that).
5. **Run (Mac)**: Figure it out yourself.

## Info

- **Memory Leaks**: 💀💀💀💀
- **Commands**: 
    - **`replace`**: Change the content of a specific line.
      - Input the line number and the new text when prompted.
    - **`save`**: Save your changes to the file.
    - **`exit`**: Exit the application.

- **Lack of Documentation**: I dont think so, but whatever.
